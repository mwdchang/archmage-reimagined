## Quick Start
Welcome to Archmage Reimaged. In this game you take the role of a powerful archmage from one of five schools of magic, each with their own unique magic and units. Guide your kingdom with your magic and the might of your armies to achieve dominion over the land of Terra.

Here are some quick tibits to get your started.

### Your first 200 turns
The first step is to setup your kingdom's basic economy, explore for about 20 turns, then build until you have around 300 `workshops`, this will give you a decent build-rate t work with. Then you should invest into researching your magic; build some `towns` and `farms` to generate geld income and population. Once your economy is going, it is time to build `guilds` to hep you research magic; spend more turns to explore and build the wilderness into guilds, typically you want between 900 to 1400 guilds to conduct research at a good pace. 

As you are building, keep an eye of your net-income in your status page, if you are running low on resources build more `towns` and `farms`. You may also want to build 70-80 `nodes` to start gathering mana for the next phase.


### After 200 turns
By now you should have a healthy kingdom going and a handful of spells in your spell book. Here is where the real game starts. Some general paths lay before you:
- You can start to summon creatures and recuit an army from your `barracks`, and strike out at your opponents before they are ready, or
- You can concentrate on finishing research, and gain access to powerful spells.

Which path would you take?

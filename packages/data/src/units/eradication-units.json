Their body and tail length combined measure more than two thousand feet. When they flap their wings, the force of the wind can knock anyone down standing nearby. They radiate a strong aura of dragon fear for any creatures who can sense it and make them flee in terror. They can breathe a searing cone of fire from their mouths and burn everything in their paths into ashes. They fight with their claws and bite when engaged in combat. Some exceptionally intelligent fire dragons can even cast spells.",
